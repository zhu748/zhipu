/**
 * Aliyun Captcha V3 solver — in-process jsdom (single binary).
 *
 * The AliyunCaptcha.js SDK is bundled as a text import (no runtime dependency
 * on the alicdn CDN — the CDN is the #1 source of solve failures in restricted
 * networks, and a local file path would break under `bun build --compile`).
 * Solve attempts are retried, and errors from the SDK's `getInstance`
 * callback are propagated rather than silently swallowed (a swallowed error
 * there means `success`/`fail` never fires and we hang until the outer
 * timeout rejects).
 *
 * Static `import { JSDOM, VirtualConsole } from "jsdom"` (not dynamic) —
 * dynamic `await import("jsdom")` returns a namespace `{ default: {...} }`
 * for the CJS package under `bun build --compile`, leaving the named exports
 * undefined. Static import lets Bun's bundler fully inline jsdom (including
 * its internal `xhr-sync-worker.js` via `require.resolve`) into the binary,
 * so the compiled exe has zero runtime dependency on node_modules.
 *
 * === OPTIMIZATION HISTORY (v0.1.5+) ===
 *
 * 1. MUTEX on getCaptchaToken — previously N concurrent start-plan requests
 *    that all hit a token cache miss would each spin up a separate JSDOM
 *    instance (50-100MB each). 4 concurrent = 400MB peak. A single mutex
 *    serializes solve attempts so only ONE JSDOM exists at a time. The
 *    second+ caller waits ~10-40s for the first to complete, then benefits
 *    from the freshly-cached token — zero JSDOM cost.
 *
 * 2. DOUBLE-CHECKED LOCKING — after acquiring the mutex, we re-check
 *    cachedToken. The first caller already solved it while we were waiting;
 *    we can return immediately without spawning another JSDOM.
 *
 * 3. ERROR CLASSIFICATION — config-fetch failures (network, JSON parse) are
 *    NOT retried (the upstream is unreachable, retrying wastes time). Only
 *    actual solve failures (SDK timeout, instance init error) trigger the
 *    retry loop. This cuts "config unavailable" retry storms from 3×40s
 *    = 120s to a single 40s attempt.
 *
 * 4. INVARIANT-VALIDATING INVALIDATE — invalidateCaptchaToken() now also
 *    clears a "solving" flag so that a re-solve triggered by a 403 doesn't
 *    race with an in-flight solve from a previous request that's about to
 *    finish. The previous race: req A starts solve → req B gets 403,
 *    invalidateCaptchaToken (sets cachedToken=null) → req A's solve
 *    completes, sets cachedToken=A's result → req B starts its own solve,
 *    overwrites cachedToken. Result: req B burned another JSDOM for nothing.
 *
 * 5. JSDOM RESOURCE CLEANUP — solveInJsdom now wraps everything in a
 *    try/finally that explicitly closes the window AND aborts pending
 *    timers / event listeners. JSDOM instances that fail to close leak
 *    their timer queue forever (memory grows ~1MB/h per leaked instance).
 *
 * 6. SOLVE TIMEOUT HONESTY — the SDK load timeout (SDK_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS)
 *    and the solve timeout (SOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS) are now independent. If the
 *    SDK fails to load (e.g. the bundled JS is corrupt), we fail fast
 *    instead of waiting for the solve timeout.
 *
 * 7. SOLVE IN-FLIGHT COALESCING — if invalidateCaptchaToken() is called
 *    WHILE a solve is in flight (e.g. concurrent 403 + the original solve
 *    hasn't finished), we set a "pendingInvalidate" flag. The in-flight
 *    solve's result is discarded (not cached), and the next
 *    getCaptchaToken() call starts a fresh solve. Without this, the
 *    stale result from the in-flight solve would be cached and used,
 *    defeating the invalidate.

/**
 * v0.1.6+ FIX: NO token cache.
 *
 * Aliyun captcha verifyParam is ONE-SHOT — zcode.z.ai consumes it on first
 * verification. If two concurrent requests share the same cached token,
 * the second request gets `{"code":3007,"msg":"captcha verify failed"}`.
 *
 * The previous v0.1.5 cache + the mutex double-checked-locking I added
 * made this worse: concurrent cache-miss callers would all get the SAME
 * token (first solves, rest hit cache). This caused 3007 errors.
 *
 * New design:
 *   - getCaptchaToken() ALWAYS solves a fresh token (no cache)
 *   - solveMutex serializes solves so only ONE JSDOM exists at a time
 *     (prevents OOM from N concurrent JSDOM instances)
 *   - handler.ts caches the token PER-REQUEST (retry reuses, 403 re-solves)
 *
 * This means concurrent requests each get their own token (safe), at the
 * cost of serialized solve latency (N requests = N × ~20s solve time).
 * For a single-user local proxy this is acceptable — concurrent
 * start-plan requests are rare.
